Instructions:

1. Application should save the purchase order into the database (I think should be SQL) after user 
submits the order

2. Save the events into an event-store (practice event-sourcing)

3. Relay the events to another event-store

3. Event store to apply changes to backup database (another SQL database)

Areas for Improvement:

1. Instead of using 2 collections for the backup Event Store,
Save the last read timestamp to Redis (Because saving to there is fast) --> more efficient

2. Using Redis to keep an INCR counter to check if message is being sent successfully (not lost)

3. Using Redis to store a set of read UUID or timestamp, before writing into backup event_store, check if the UUID already exist in Redis (prevent duplicate events)
